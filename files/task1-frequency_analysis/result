THE OSCARS TURN  ON SUNDAY WHICH SEEMS ABOUT RINHT AFTER THIS LONN STRANNE
AWARDS TRIP THE BANNER FEELS LIsE A NONANENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS BOOsENDED BY THE DEMISE OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED BY
THE EMERNENCE OF METOO TIMES UP BLACsNOWN POLITICS ARMCANDY ACTIVISM AND
A NATIONAL CONVERSATION AS BRIEF AND MAD AS A FEVER DREAM ABOUT WHETHER THERE
OUNHT TO BE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT JUST SEEM EXTRA LONN IT WAS
EXTRA LONN BECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOVED TO THE FIRST WEEsEND IN MARCH TO
AVOID CONFLICTINN WITH THE CLOSINN CEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS THANsS
PYEONNCHANN

ONE BIN jUESTION SURROUNDINN THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE NOLDEN NLOBES WHICH BECAME
A JUBILANT COMINNOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOVEMENT SPEARHEADED BY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FINHT SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY

SINNALINN THEIR SUPPORT NOLDEN NLOBES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELVES IN BLACs
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF ABOUT SEXIST POWER IMBALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STANE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT ABOUT PAY INEjUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER jUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAsINN FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURINN THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOs A BLUNT
AND SATISFYINN DIN AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT BE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROBABLY WONT BE

WOMEN INVOLVED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUNH THE NLOBES SINNIFIED THE
INITIATIVES LAUNCH THEY NEVER INTENDED IT TO BE JUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAINN OR ONE THAT BECAME ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOsESWOMAN SAID THE NROUP IS WORsINN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LENAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE NLOBES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR BLACs NOWNS WENT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUNH THE
MOVEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE REFERENCED BEFORE AND DURINN THE CEREMONY 
ESPECIALLY SINCE VOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIsE ASHLEY JUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE sIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY sNOWS WHO IS NOINN TO WIN BEST
PICTURE ARNUABLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARNUABLY THE NAILBITER
NARRATIVE ONLY SERVES THE AWARDS HYPE MACHINE BUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTINN
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLONISTS CAN MAsE ONLY EDUCATED NUESSES

THE WAY THE ACADEMY TABULATES THE BIN WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EVERY OTHER
CATENORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS BUT IN THE BEST PICTURE
CATENORY VOTERS ARE ASsED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOVIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOVIE NETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE VOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOVIE MANANES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE VOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS VOTES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO THE MOVIES THAT NARNERED THE ELIMINATED BALLOTS
SECONDPLACE VOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERNES

IT IS ALL TERRIBLY CONFUSINN BUT APPARENTLY THE CONSENSUS FAVORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INVARIABLY
INVOLVES TORTURED SPECULATION ABOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIsELY BE VOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAVORITE AND THEN EjUALLY TORTURED CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHICH
FILM MINHT PREVAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP BETWEEN BOYHOOD AND THE EVENTUAL WINNER BIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EXPERTS BETTINN ON THE REVENANT OR THE BIN SHORT THE
PRIZE WENT TO SPOTLINHT LAST YEAR NEARLY ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIVE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEY WERE
CORRECT BEFORE AN ENVELOPE SNAFU WAS REVEALED AND THE RINHTFUL WINNER
MOONLINHT WAS CROWNED

THIS YEAR AWARDS WATCHERS ARE UNEjUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THREE BILLBOARDS
OUTSIDE EBBINN MISSOURI THE FAVORITE AND THE SHAPE OF WATER WHICH IS
THE BANNERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTINN A HAIL MARY WIN FOR NET OUT

BUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAVE HISTORICAL OSCARVOTINN PATTERNS ANAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE YEARS BEST BY THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS NUILDS YET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS NUILD AWARD FOR BEST ENSEMBLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON BEST PICTURE WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY LANDINN AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE BRAVEHEART IN  THIS YEAR THE BEST ENSEMBLE SAN ENDED UP NOINN TO
THREE BILLBOARDS WHICH IS SINNIFICANT BECAUSE ACTORS MAsE UP THE ACADEMYS
LARNEST BRANCH THAT FILM WHILE DIVISIVE ALSO WON THE BEST DRAMA NOLDEN NLOBE
AND THE BAFTA BUT ITS FILMMAsER MARTIN MCDONANH WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST
DIRECTOR AND APART FROM ARNO MOVIES THAT LAND BEST PICTURE WITHOUT ALSO
EARNINN BEST DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
